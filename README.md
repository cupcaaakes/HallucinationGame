GAIA

GAIA is an interactive experience created for the "Mirror Machines 3: Relations" exhibit, hosted as a collaboration by the Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences and Hochschule Pforzheim. It was created by Amelia Hantke (Programming, concept and writing), Madeline Herman (Art), Max Keune and Charlotte Hanke (Music and sound design).

This interactive experience requires an Azure Kinect to play. Instructions for that are located within the final build's README.
